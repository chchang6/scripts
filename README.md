# scripts
Various scripts, programs, and notebooks written over the years,
mostly centered on electronic structure and molecular dynamics studies
of hydrogenase and singlet fission systems, some systems biology utilities,
and some HPC support functions.

This repository mostly serves as a personal archive, but if anyone finds
anything useful, have at it (under license and copyright constraints, of course).
