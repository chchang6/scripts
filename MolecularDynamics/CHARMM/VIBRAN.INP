! Minimization with cutoffs for non-bonded interactions. Parameters
! are distance for constructing pair list (cutnb), distance at which
! switching function eliminates contributions from a pair (ctofnb), and
! distance at which smoothing begins (ctonnb). Default 14-12-10, adapting
! to 12A cutoff in Noskov & Lim
