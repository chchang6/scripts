# Code to carry out Pathways analysis as described in Science 282: 1285-8 (1991).
# Build a list of lists, each with two components: a list of atom indices, and a float.
# The atom index list is an ordered Pathway; the float is the cumulative transfer integral
# value.
#
# For each "terminal" atom in an atomselection list, create a list of "next atoms"
# within direct transfer distance and with the angle between the terminal atom-acceptor
# vector and the terminal atom-next atom vector less than 90 degrees.
#
# For each interaction, determine if it's covalently bonded, hydrogen bonded, or through-space.
# Then create new lists, each with the present Pathway and appending the next atom.
#
# Calculate the float value by multiplying the old value by the value for the appropriate
# interaction type. Test the float; if it falls below the threshold (to be given by user
# through graphical interface), remove the entry from the list.
#
# Continue until the acceptor is reached; once it is, move that Pathway to a collection list.
# Once the analysis is done, the user should be able to plot all Pathways with integrals above
# a defined value onto the structure.
